	<h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
		<p>The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo, is a time management method which encourages you to work in brief, effective bursts (Pomodoros). Named after the legendary tomato-timer, the technique allows users to work during pre-determined blocks of time - no more, no less - and to take regular breaks.

	<h3>Why are there 'Moods'?</h3>
	<p> We believe that there is a gentler way to organize your day. By organizing your time, with plenty of breaks included, Pomodoro helps you to work your best and keep your mind well-rested. In order to achieve this, it is important to create a working environment conducive to productivity. This requires your mind to feel at ease. The Moods are ambient sounds designed to cut through the noise of everyday life without distracting you from your work. You can even design your own mood tracks to ensure your Pomodoros are as productive as possible. From the sound of ocean waves to the rustling of trees, you can tailor your workspace to suit your needs.
They say that "art is how you decorate space and music is how you decorate time." With moods, you can make your time count, and make it count beautifully.
