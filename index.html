  <p> Does spicy food get you hot and bothered? Want coffee that will stir you up? Don't think the best burrito places should be kept under wraps? Or do you just love terrible puns? </p>

  <p> Then look no further than IndiscrEAT Bristol! We've declassified Bristol's tastiest food because we don't believe that good food should be kept hidden. We’ve got the gift of gab and the gift of gobble, so if you’re looking for a vegan fry-up, halal lunch or gluten free dinner, you can count on us to tell you all about it. Whatever you choose, it’ll be so good that you won’t be able to keep it a secret! Some might say, you’ll even be indiscr… well, you get the point. </p>

  <p> A website made by students, FOR the students! </p>
